# Todo Application
In this folder is present an application and some demo examples that I have developped in accordance with a simple udemy <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/full-stack-application-with-spring-boot-and-react/">tutorial</a> that I have followed!

The application illustrates simple functionality of login, listing, updating, deleting and creating tasks.

This is my first application where the frontend is written in React.
